# PostManDijkstra

Implementation of Dijkstra algorithm for custom problem. 

Idea is to send a letter to each city (node), while postman (edge) has time-schedule of when he lefts the town. Transfer cost is 0 (postman goes from city A to B and back in given times). Starting city (node) is always 1. 
Goal is to find quickest way to contact each node.
